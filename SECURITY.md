## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email: **security@memolib.com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within **48 hours** and provide a timeline for a fix.

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication
- NextAuth.js with secure session management
- 2FA support (TOTP)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- HTTPS only in production
- Secure headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- XSS protection

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Tenant isolation (multi-tenancy)
- API rate limiting (Upstash)
- CORS configuration
- Zero-trust architecture

### Monitoring
- Sentry error tracking
- Audit logs (EventLog immutable)
- Security event logging
- Automated vulnerability scanning (GitGuardian)

### Dependencies
- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Regular security audits (`npm audit`)
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Verified packages only

## 🔐 Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use `.env.local` for local development
   - Use platform secrets for production
   - Check with GitGuardian before pushing

2. **Validate all inputs**
   - Use Zod schemas for validation
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Escape outputs

3. **Follow OWASP Top 10**
   - Injection prevention
   - Broken authentication prevention
   - Sensitive data exposure prevention
   - XML external entities prevention
   - Broken access control prevention
   - Security misconfiguration prevention
   - XSS prevention
   - Insecure deserialization prevention
   - Using components with known vulnerabilities prevention
   - Insufficient logging & monitoring prevention

4. **Code Review**
   - All PRs require security review
   - Automated security checks in CI/CD
   - Manual review for sensitive changes
